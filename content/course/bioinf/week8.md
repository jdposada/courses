<!--more-->

{{< icon name="clock" pack="fas" >}} 2 - 4 Hours

## Class Content

- In this class we will describe methods to generate:
    - Features from advance deep learning models such as [BEHRT](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62922-y)
    - Features from clinical text using Dictionary Lookups, entity Linking or Name Entity Recognition. 

### In-Class Activity

- Follow the OHDSI PLP example to create a simple Deep Learning Model using Eunomia as the dataset
- Create a Dockerfile to create a Docker Image that enables to run [medspacy](https://github.com/medspacy/medspacy).
- Follow a simple example to create a Jupyter Notebook that uses the Docker Image and runs medspacy on sample text.

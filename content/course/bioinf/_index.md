## Dev Environment

The primary language of this course will be R

We will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) running on [Google Colab](https://colab.to/r). We will cover both things on the course, but feel free to peek! 

We will also use our Github Repo (to be posted next week). There you will find the development environment

Plagiarism includes: 
- Using content without proper reference
- Literally or with minimal changes that do not alter the spirit of the text
- Acquire with or without intention, works of third parties and present them partially or totally as their own
- Present group work where some of the members did not work or where there was no demonstrable teamwork
- Other situations defined in the academic [fraud manual of the Universidad del Norte](https://guayacan.uninorte.edu.co/normatividad_interna/upload/File/Guia_Prevencion_Fraude%20estudiantes(5).pdf)


Additionally, all work related to this subject:

- It must be done individually, unless the teacher indicates otherwise. Impersonation is a serious offense.
- It must be done in the time frame specified by the teacher.
- You must reference third-party libraries or algorithms that have been used in the source code.
- It must be sent by the means defined by the teacher (Brightspace/Google Forms). In case of not using the means established for the development of the course, it will be assumed that the work was not sent (this include e-mails).

### Students with Disabilities

Please let me know if you have any documented conditions and we will do our best to provide assistance

{{< icon name="clock" pack="fas" >}} 2 - 3 Hours

## Class content

- The link for class slides will be here at the end of the week

## Assignments

- Read the [Plant UML language specification](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram) for a Class Diagram
- Run the Plant UML code generated in our last class but inside VS code. Instructions in how to do that can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) 
- Search on the web for a real case us of UML to specify a class diagram for a Python application. It does not need to be complicated and it is ok if you do not understand everything that is going on.

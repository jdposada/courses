## Class content

- Encapsulation and composition class slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EHxluyrsUO5fgy0kgzoxXbIliamj5RV7Il009loAfSI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Assignments

- Read the [Plant UML language specification](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram) for a Class Diagram
- Run the Plant UML code generated in our last class but inside VS code. Instructions in how to do that can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) 
- Search on the web for a real case us of UML to specify a class diagram for a Python application. It does not need to be complicated and it is ok if you do not understand everything that is going on.

## Learn

Few videos with nice short tutorials to create Class Diagrams with Plant UML. The last one is using Lucid Chart but it is a nice video for UML for class diagrams

We will cover the basics of Python Programming and Cloud Computing\nCourse Description The course introduces the student to the fundamental concepts of Systems Engineering: its theoretical bases, disciplinary components and close relationship with Data Analytics. It is the duty of the systems engineering student to develop and exercise the capacity for abstraction in order to understand system dynamics and detect opportunities for improvement. The application of this skill permeates areas of Systems Engineering: Theoretical Computer Science, Computational Applications, Computer Systems, Software Engineering, and Data Assimilation. When systemic thinking is achieved, failures in systems can be easily detected and improvements suggested and implemented\nCourse Justification The purpose of the course is to give students a comprehensive view of the Systems Engineering career through exposure to topics and situations (problems) typical of the discipline. This supports the correct understanding of what Systems Engineering consists of.\nABET Student Outcome (SO 3) The ability to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences\nhttps://www.abet.org/\nCourse Schedule   Evaluations and policies Below the items that will be part of the evaluation of this course.

This study of the topics is carried out through a gradual process from the concept of classes and objects to the construction of object-oriented software.\nThe course has two great moments. The first part is focused on giving the student the theoretical tools and principles for the design of solutions to problems, through UML diagrams and their implementation in software. In the second part, the student focuses on software development from a proposed design using standard design patterns, testing their ability to interpret the designs at the time of implementation.\nCourse Justification Traditional techniques (structured or procedural programming) for application development tend to produce fragile systems that are difficult to maintain, especially when their size is relatively large. Object-oriented programming emerges as a programming paradigm that helps mitigate the shortcomings of previous techniques and helps build quality software.\nMain Outcome Students who successfully complete this course will be able to apply and interpret the concepts of Object Oriented Programming in the solution design processes and in the development of applications, in accordance with clear requirements and following engineering standards.\nLearning Outcomes   CO1 Clearly define the basic concepts related to Object Oriented Programming. This item will be evaluated through theoretical questions where the student must clearly define the basic concepts related to OOP.\n  CO2 Identify and design class structures that support the solution of a given problem. This item will be evaluated in the first part, based on the models proposed by the students for the solution of problems given in class, which should follow the OOP paradigm.\n  CO3 Implement applications using a programming language, from the interpretation of a given diagram. This item will be assessed on all exams and on the lab project. Not only the operation of the application will be taken into account, but also if it complies with the OO programming paradigm and with the proposed model.\n  CO4 Formulate and execute a software engineering project, with specific roles and professional guidelines, following the Object-Oriented paradigm.\n  ABET Student Outcome SO(2) An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. This item will be evaluated in the development of the final project, especially in compliance with the design requirements.\nhttps://www.abet.org/\nCourse Schedule   Evaluations and policies Below the items that will be part of the evaluation of this course.

You just need to read and if you wish you could follow along some of the examples using the sample Eunomia Dataset.  Here is the portion of the documentation that describes how the features are generated Here is the pre-specified analyses CSV. The SQL files mentioned there are very hard to read because they are supporting a wide range of use cases.

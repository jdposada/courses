We will cover the basics of Python Programming and Cloud Computing\nCourse Description The course introduces the student to the fundamental concepts of Systems Engineering: its theoretical bases, disciplinary components and close relationship with Data Analytics. It is the duty of the systems engineering student to develop and exercise the capacity for abstraction in order to understand system dynamics and detect opportunities for improvement. The application of this skill permeates areas of Systems Engineering: Theoretical Computer Science, Computational Applications, Computer Systems, Software Engineering, and Data Assimilation. When systemic thinking is achieved, failures in systems can be easily detected and improvements suggested and implemented\nCourse Justification The purpose of the course is to give students a comprehensive view of the Systems Engineering career through exposure to topics and situations (problems) typical of the discipline. This supports the correct understanding of what Systems Engineering consists of.\nABET Student Outcome (SO 3) The ability to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences\nhttps://www.abet.org/\nCourse Schedule   Evaluations and policies Below the items that will be part of the evaluation of this course.
